# Budget-Tracker

 ## Description

 This is a project that tested my skills in creating a budget app for either a traveler, or just someone looking to keep control of their finances. 
 Using lessons from class and help from a tutor, I created a financial transaction that can be used by the everyday person.

  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies run the following command:
  ```
  npm i
  ```

  ## Usage

  I used JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, and HTML to complete this app.
  This app will keep track of the users finances over a period of time. the user can input both increases and decreases in money amount, a description of the transaction, and keep track of all their transactions.
  This app schould be used by someone who has a specific budget for a trip, or just looking to not spend too much each month, and is great for keeping them on track.
  Maybe later I could go back in and add some more CSS styling to make it more visually appealing.
